# EasyPacketSharp

EasyPacketSharp is a minimalistic packet library to wrap up the function-based behaviour of .NET Sockets in a more friendly callback event-driven environment. 
It's written with .NET 4.6 and C# 6 to support the latest optimizations so it can easily be incorporated into any modern game or application.
